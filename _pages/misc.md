<h4>Exercise History</h4>
I've always been a sports enthusiast and here is my fitness journey:

<ul class="space_list">
    <li> Soccer: I've been playing since I could walk, though these days it's more sporadic.</li>
    <li> Gym: Since January 2023, <strike>I've been hitting the gym regularly.</strike> Focus shifting to Crossfit these days though...</li>
    <li> Sports Climbing (Bouldering): From mid-2022 to early 2023, I don't climb as often now, but I still enjoy tackling the wall when I get the chance.</li>
    <li> Crossfit: I tried CrossFit from March to June 2023. <strike>and I'm on the lookout for a good box to get back into it.</strike> 
    <strike>Returned to the box in December 2024 (Hoosier CrossFit)! Up until early March, I dealt with a shoulder "injury" (mainly inflammation and calcification).</strike> <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/BFQsugR7KseKtVHh6" target="_blank">University Avenue CrossFit</a> is now my new home!</li>
    <li> Swimming: Since December 2023, mainly sticking to breaststroke in my apartment swimming pool...</li>
    <li> Running: It's not my primary focus. <strike>just something I do occasionally.</strike> Trying to do a long run every week these days.</li>
</ul>
