### What academic figures say about writing

A collection of insights/tips/rules of thumbs on academic writing (that resonates with me). 

####  ["on writing."](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~patt/writing/) by Yale Patt 

Yale Patt, a renowned professor on computer architecuture said:
*"What a man (today we would say man or woman) knows or what a man thinks is lost if he can not express it through oratory or writing."*

My summary: 
- **Focus on the reader**: You're writing for others to understand, not for yourself.
- **Use clear, simple language**:
  - Prefer short sentences over long ones
  - Use active voice instead of passive voice
  - Choose simple words over complex/fancy ones "delicatessen" is the only 5-syllable word used by Yale.
  - It is not necessary to stick "ize" at the end of any random noun and invent a new one.
  - It is okay to use the same word again in the same paragraph if none of threasures mean exactly what you want to say.  
  - It is not okay to make spelling mistakes. 



- **Break unnecessary rules when needed**:
  - Some traditional grammar guides say you shouldn’t end a sentence with a preposition (like with, at, to, of, etc.).
  - Churchill's example: "That kind of nonsense up with which I refuse to put" (*put up with* is more natural but breaks the rule) 
  - It's better to end a sentence with a preposition than create awkward constructions


[Yale Patt's lecture "Stew" (2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY3C7Bvbn3g) talks more about this.

#### ["Storytelling 101: Writing Tips for Academics"](https://greatresearch.org/2013/10/11/storytelling-101-writing-tips-for-academics/) by Nick Feamster and Alex Gray

ChatGPT summary: 
- **Focus on the story**: Academic writing should tell a clear and compelling story—your research is the plot.  
- **Clarity over complexity**: Avoid jargon and write as if you're explaining your work to an intelligent but unfamiliar reader.  
- **Structure matters**: Start with a high-level view, then dive into details. Think of each section as a scene in the story.  
- **Writing is part of the research**: Writing helps clarify your own thinking; don’t wait until the end of a project to start.  
- **Good writing enhances impact**: A well-structured, clearly written paper with a decent idea is more likely to be accepted than a confusing paper with a brilliant idea.

ChatGPT summary: 
- **Make your contribution clear**: Spell out what's new and important. Don't expect readers to infer it.  
- **Know the literature**: Show that you're aware of related work and explain how yours is different or better.  
- **Avoid hype**: Let the significance of your work speak for itself—don’t oversell.  
- **Be honest about limitations**: Reviewers appreciate when authors acknowledge what their system can’t do.  
- **Clarity reflects thinking**: Confusing writing often signals unclear ideas. Clear writing = clear thinking.
